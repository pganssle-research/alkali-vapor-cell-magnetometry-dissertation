Alkali Vapor-Cell Magnetometry and its Application to Relaxometry and Diffusometry
===========================================

This is my PhD Thesis, covering much of the work I did in Alexander Pines' lab from 2008-2014. It covers the developoment and use of a zero-field alkali vapor cell magnetometer at low and zero fields.

The work described primarily in Chapter 6 was published as the front cover of *Angewandte Chemie* on [September 8, 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201403416/abstract).

Nearly all figures in this work were generated using the [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library for Python. The source code for these figures is available in "figures", and where possible the data sources are included.

The final document in PDF form is available in this repository - [here is a direct link to the PDF](https://github.com/pganssle-research/alkali-vapor-cell-magnetometry-dissertation/raw/master/Paul%20Ganssle%20-%20Alkali%20Vapor-Cell%20Magnetometry%20and%20its%20Application%20to%20Low-Field%20Relaxometry%20and%20Diffusometry.pdf).
