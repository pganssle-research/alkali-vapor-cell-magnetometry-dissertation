\chapter{Blueprints}
% An appendix dedicated to blueprints of various components of the magnetometers, labeled with scales
\label{blueprints}
Many of the components of the magnetometer have been designed and re-designed during the process of development of a practical device for NMR measurements. This appendix collects each of these designs for all components of the magnetometer to document these changes and give a more exact sense of the instrumentation used in these experiments. Strictly speaking, these are technical drawings produced by AutoCAD, and are not produced by blue-printing, a process wherein technical drawings are copied by the application of a light to the originals, which sit on top of a paper coated in a ferro-gallate solution. The ferro-gallate solution is light-sensitive, and where no lines are present exposure causes the ferro-gallate to convert into a stable blue dye. With the advent of digital home printing, this process is no longer necessary, and the word ``blueprint'' is merely a skeuomorph from a bygone age.
