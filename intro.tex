\label{Chapter:Introduction}
The goal of this document is to provide a practical road map for the construction and use of alkali vapor-cell magnetometers for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), particularly measurements of relaxation and diffusion. While the story is told through the lens of my experience doing just that, it is intended to have somewhat more general applicability. 

\Cref{mag.design} serves as a brief introduction to the operational concepts in alkali-vapor-cell magnetometry. \Cref{magnetometer.design} goes into detail about the design decisions and trade offs involved in the construction of an atomic magnetometer for the purposes of making NMR measurements. \Cref{Chapter:Console} covers primarily the software used for controlling the experiments. \Cref{Chapter:NMR} covers strategies for performing low-field NMR experiments that can be performed in our zero-field magnetometer, and \Cref{relaxometry} covers our relaxometry and diffusometry experiments specifically.
